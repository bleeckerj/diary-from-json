1. **Project Context**:
    - The markdown documents to be converted are a free-form diary of my experiences, thoughts, reflections of my time while I was running my startup company, OMATA.
    - They contain personal reflections, snapshots (images), various included screenshots, and other notes and scrapbook-like entries.
    - I created this knowing that some day I would want to look back at this experience and put it into a book format.
    - The free-form nature of the documents can possibly be converted into a more structure format so that I can more easily organize and present the diary entries.
    - Most diary entries contain a date that heads the entry.
    - The entries are typically text, but also contain images and other elements like tables, inserted screenshots, and other media.
    - This project is a convesion utility that converts unstructured markdown documents into structure JSON format.
    - The primary goal is to extract relevant information from text documents and represent it in a structured JSON format.
    - The text documents are a mix of plain text, dates, images, tables and other elements.
    - The purpose of the conversion utility it to pre-process the markdown documents so that a more comprehensive program can convert and prepare the images, text, dates into a well-designed print-ready format.

2. **Coding Guidelines**:
   - Follow best practices for code organization and modularity.
   - Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
   - Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance code readability.
   - Ensure that the code is well-tested and includes unit tests for critical functionality.

3. **Functionality Requirements**:
    - The utility should read markdown files and extract structured data.
    - The objective is to determine the date of each entry, the text content, and any associated images or media and contain each diary entry into a structured JSON format.
    - The JSON structure should include fields for the date, text content, images, and any other relevant metadata.
    - The utility can include the use of AI to help infer relevant content and what part of the structure it should be placed in. 
    - That is, the utility itself should be "AI enabled" to help with the conversion process as it runs.
    - The output of the utility should be a JSON file that contains all the structured data extracted from the markdown files.
